Running OpenMP programs on a \gls{cluster} is not a new idea.
It has been tried with various success several times in the past.
On the following pages the focus shall be on Cluster OpenMP \cite{comp}, ClusterSs \cite{clusterss}, 
OmpSs \cite{ompss} and XcalableMP \cite{xmp}.
All of those examples try to extend OpenMP with the capability to use more than one node of a \gls{cluster}.

## \comp
This was an approach to solve the exactly same problem as this thesis by expanding the intel compiler.
There is one major difference, in 2007?, when \comp was designed, tasks were not a part of \omp
