Running OpenMP programs on a \gls{cluster} is not a new idea.
It has been tried with various success several times in the past.
On the following pages the focus shall be on Cluster OpenMP \cite{comp}, ClusterSs \cite{clusterss}, 
OmpSs \cite{ompss} and XcalableMP \cite{xmp}.
All of those examples try to extend OpenMP with the capability to use more than one node of a \gls{cluster}.
